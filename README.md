# Unit 5 Project Workspace
This repository is where I will be saving working code for the Learning Journal project, 
for troubleshooting and review in the Treehouse Slack channel.  

** Build a Learning Journal with Flask **

Project Overview
Create an interface for a learning journal web application. The main (index) page lists 
journal entry titles and dates. Each journal entry title links to a detail page that 
displays the title, date, time spent, the journal entry, and resources related to the learning.

The application lets the user add or edit journal entries. When adding or editing a 
journal entry, the application prompts the user for title, date, time spent, what they 
learned, and resources to remember. The results for these entries are stored in a database 
and displayed in a blog style website.
